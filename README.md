# Dogfight
A little pygame-based game I made. Control a plane, shoot things, pretty straightforward.

So far, a plane can be controlled as follows:

A or Left to turn left

D or Right to turn right

W or Up to increase speed

S or Down to decrease speed

Space or Left Shift to shoot a single bullet

Several airships are spawned with random coordinates and rotation, once hit five times by a bullet, they explode.
