# Dogfight
A little pygame-based game I made. Control a plane, shoot things, pretty straightforward.

So far, a plane can be controlled as follows:
A or Left to turn left
D or Right to turn right
W or Up to increase speed
S or Down to decrease speed
Space or Left Shift to shoot a single bullet

An airship is spawned with a random rotation, once hit five times by a bullet, it explodes.
TODO: Make the explosion disappear after a certain amount of time
